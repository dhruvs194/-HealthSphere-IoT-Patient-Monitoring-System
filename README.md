# -HealthSphere-IoT-Patient-Monitoring-System
The "IoT Based Patient Health Monitoring System" is a project designed to leverage Internet of Things (IoT) technology for continuous and real-time monitoring of patients' vital signs and health parameters. The system aims to provide remote healthcare monitoring, enabling timely intervention in case of health anomalies or emergencies.
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and efficient IoT system for patient health monitoring, including monitoring vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and oxygen levels using MAX30100, DS18B20 and DHT11 sensors. The system will transmit this data to a central server and make it accessible to healthcare providers and patients through a mobile application.
